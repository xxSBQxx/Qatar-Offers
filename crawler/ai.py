"""Local, self-contained offer extraction engine.

No hosted AI, Gemini, or Google Search API keys are required to run. The
extractor itself is transparent Python rules (regex + heuristics) plus
optional local Tesseract OCR for promo banners (never uploaded anywhere).

Categorization (what category/subcategory/tags an extracted offer belongs
to) is handled separately in categorize.py: a weighted rule classifier that
reads the full offer, with an optional Anthropic API escalation for offers
it isn't confident about (see categorize.py and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY).
